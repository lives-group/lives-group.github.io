Inspired by [Brent Yourgey](http://byorgey.wordpress.com)'s post, I've
decided to setup not a _Maniac week_, but a _Maniac Spring_!
The idea is just to eliminate as many distractions as possible, and
just work (yes, I'll reduce coffee time...).

I'm planning to finish the following set of objectives this
fall:

- Work on some unpublished results of my thesis.
- Supervise two students to produce publishable results.
- Continue to write a discrete mathematics book, for the classes that
   I teach on UFOP.
- Prepare my classes of Discrete Mathematics and Formal Language
  Theory.
- Continue to study dependently typed languages, specially Agda.
- Study the
  [Holy Trinity](http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/the-holy-trinity/)
  of computer science. Yes, this is a _very_ crazy objective. I have
  some videos and tons of materias about these. Let's use it now!

Later, I'll post a schedule that I'll follow during this fall and
regularly update the progresses I've made in this blog.

Let's see if this idea of a maniac period of time works for me...
