So, after a long pause, I'll start to blog again. And, since my last
post was about the so called `Maniac Spring`, where I've set some
ambitious objectives, let's see what I've finished:

- *Work on some unpublished results of my thesis*. I've spent little
time with this topic, since after almost 5 years working in type
inference for Haskell, I'm tired of such stuff. Because of that, I've
put this aside. But this was good, since now I have some ideas on how
to improve type inference in the presence of Generalised Algebraic
Data Types. I probably start some implementation of these ideas really soon.
- *Supervise two students to produce publishable results*. This was a
  bit problematic due to some problems, but, I believe that still time
  to get something to SBLP
  2015 --- Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages.
- *Continue to write a discrete mathematics book, for the classes that
  I teach on UFOP*. At least, one objective was achieved. I've
  finished a first book draft which is available [here](https://github.com/rodrigogribeiro/apostila-discreta).
- *Prepare my classes of Discrete Mathematics and Formal Language Theory*. These are also done.
- *Continue to study dependently typed languages, specially Agda*. I've
  spent a lot of time programming in Agda lately. Soon I'll continue
  to write more about my Agda related adventures.
- *Study the
  [Holy Trinity](http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/the-holy-trinity/)
  of computer science*. Since, during my PhD, I've studied a lot of
  type systems, I focused on learning Proof Theory and Category
  Theory. I've spent a lot of time trying to formalize proof theory
  results in Agda. I'm having difficulties on how to represent
  contexts in order to get a appropriate representation of sequent
  calculus. But this I'll be a subject of a future post.

I did not get all tasks finished, but I believe that setting those
objectives helped me to get focused on them or on a subset of them.
