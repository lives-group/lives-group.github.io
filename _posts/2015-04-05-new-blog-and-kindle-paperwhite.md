As you can see, I've updated my blog to use pure
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) instead of
[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com). The main reason for
the change was the lack of updates of Jekyll Bootstrap. But, since
blogging process and structure was the same, I just decide to use
plain Jekyll. In order to get this beautiful layout, I google for
some templates and find [Poole](http://getpoole.com), a ready template
for Jekyll blogs.

Kindle Paperwhite
--------------

Two weeks ago, I've bought a Kindle Paperwhite for reading ebooks and
articles in pdf. All that I can say is it worth a buy. The gadget is
lightweight and process pdf's in a perfect way. So, if you want to buy
a tablet to read articles in pdf format, forget it! Buy a Kindle,
since it is cheaper and, to read, works better than a tablet.

Together with Kindle, I've bought a Category theory book by Harold
Simmons. I'm planning to start a post series on implementing category
theory in Agda, as a way to consolidate my understanding of this topic.
