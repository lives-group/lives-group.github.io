LiVES is the Programming Languages, Software Verification and Specification research group of 
[Departament of Computer Science](www.decom.ufop.br) of
[Federal University of Ouro Preto (UFOP)](www.ufop.br), MG, Brazil.

# Research themes

Our vision is to use mathematics to understand the **nature of computation**, and to turn that 
understanding into the next generation of **programming languages** and software verification tools.

Throught the [Curry-Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curryâ€“Howard_correspondence) we 
see mathematics and its foundations as an activity that has an essential programming nature. Our main 
research tools to achieve better solutions to programming / mathematical problems are:

* Functional Programming: Using modern programming languages like [Haskell](www.haskell.org), 
[Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/) and [Coq](www.coq.inria.fr).

* Logics: We use non-classical logics as a formal language to specify software requirements.

* Type theory: We design type systems and its checking / inference algorithms as a tool for checking
code and provide better programming abstractions.
