I am a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP), Minas Gerais, Brazil.

I graduated from Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto in 2005, and obtained my PhD at the Universidade Federal de Minas
Gerais in 2013 under the supervision of Dr. [Carlos Camarão](http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~camarao/).

During 2016-2017 I did a post-doc at Universidade Federal de Pelotas, under the supervision of André Rauber Du Bois.

# Research interests

My research interests lie broadly within the fields of programming languages design and implementation and software engineering. More specifically, I have a particular interest in building correct by construction software using type theory-based proof assistants.
