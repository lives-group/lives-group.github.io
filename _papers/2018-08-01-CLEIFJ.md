Currently, Java is one of the most used programming language, being adopted in many large projects,
where applications reach a level of complexity for which manual testing and human inspection are not 
enough to guarantee quality in software development. Even when using automated unit tests, such tests 
rarely cover all interesting cases of code, which means that a bug could never be discovered, once the 
code is tested against the same set of rules over and over again. This paper addresses the problem of 
generating random well-typed programs in the context of Featherweight Java, a well-known object-oriented 
calculus, using QuickCheck, a Haskell library for property-based testing.
