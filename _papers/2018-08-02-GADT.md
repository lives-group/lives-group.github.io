Support for generalized algebraic data types (GADT) in extensions of Haskell allows functions 
defined over GADTs to be written without the need for type annotations in some cases, but it 
requires type annotations in most of them. This paper presents a type inference algorithm for 
GADTs that extends OutsideIn algorithm using anti-unification to capture the relationship between 
the types of arguments and result of GADT functions. This approach allows inference in cases where 
the relationship between types of pattern matches is explicit in the code, allowing the type annotation 
in cases where the relationship is not explicit.
