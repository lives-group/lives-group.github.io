Unification is the core of type inference algorithms for modern functional programming languages, like Haskell and SML. As a first step towards a formalization of a type inference algorithm for such programming languages, we present a formalization in Coq of a type unification algorithm that follows classic algorithms presented in programming language textbooks. We also report on the use of such formalization to build a correct type inference algorithm for the simply typed λ-calculus.
