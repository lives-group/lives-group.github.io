Software maintenance is an stage of software development process that consumes great developers effort, raising total cost of the project. Du- ring this process, a comprehension task of the system implementation is requi- red. Therefore, tools supporting this proccess may facilitate the developer work. This paper shows a query language for source code based on relational concepts which works on a syntactic representation augmented with static semantics of the program (scopes, declarations and symbols use). It is presented, as vali- dation, how this source code query language may be applied in the program comprehension activity.
