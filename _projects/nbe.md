title: "Normalization by Evaluation for Lambda Calculi"
collection: projects
---

The main objective of this project is to define denotational
semantics for some lambda-calculi systems and use them to
create normalization by evaluation algorithms for these systems;
using proof-assistant languages such as Agda.
