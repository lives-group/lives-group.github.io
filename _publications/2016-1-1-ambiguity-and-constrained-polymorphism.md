This paper considers the problem of ambiguity in Haskell-like languages. 
The relation between ambiguity and overloading resolution and the disadvantages 
of following the standard notion of ambiguity in the con- text of constrained 
polymorphism are exposed and discussed. A new definition of ambiguity is presented, 
where existence of more than one instance for an expression type is considered only 
after overloading resolution. We identify overloading resolution by the presence of 
unreachable variables in constraints on the type of the expression. We discuss 
advantages of adopting this ambiguity definition in Haskell.
