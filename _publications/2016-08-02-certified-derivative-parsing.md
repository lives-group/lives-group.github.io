We describe the formalization of a certified algorithm for regular expression 
parsing based on Brzozowski derivatives, in the dependently typed language Idris. 
The formalized algorithm produces a proof that an input string matches a given regular 
expression or a proof that no matching exists. A tool for regular expression based 
search in the style of the well known GNU grep has been developed with the certified 
algorithm, and practical experiments were conducted with this tool.
