As computer programs become increasingly complex, techniques for ensuring trustworthiness of 
information manipulated by them become critical. In this work, we use the Coq proof assistant 
to formalise a λ-calculus with trust types, originally formulated by Ørbæk and Palsberg. We give 
formal proofs of type soundness, erasure and simulation theorems and also prove decidability of 
the typing problem. As a result of our formalisation a certified type checker is derived.
