Unification is the core of type inference algorithms for mod- ern functional programming languages, 
like Haskell. As a first step towards a formalization of a type inference algorithm for such 
programming languages, we present a formalization in Coq of a type unification algorithm that follows 
classic algorithms presented in programming language textbooks.
