We describe the formalization of a regular expression (RE) parsing algorithm
that produces a bit representation of its parse tree in the dependently typed
language Agda.  The algorithm computes bit-codes using Brzozowski derivatives
and we prove that produced codes are equivalent to parse trees ensuring soundness
and completeness w.r.t an inductive RE semantics. We include the certified algorithm
in a tool developed by us, named verigrep, for regular expression based search in
the style of the well known GNU grep. Practical experiments conducted with this tool
are reported.
